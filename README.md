## ✨ v12.2 — Dashboard Overhaul & Workspace System (NEW)

### 🗂️ Workspace Tab
- **Files by agent role** — Workspace files organised by the agent that created them, with collapsible sections.
- **Inline editor** — Click any file to view and edit it directly in the dashboard.
- **Human comment system** — Leave feedback on any file. Comments are injected into the agent's next run prompt.
- **Comments sidecar** — Stored as `{filename}.comments.json`, automatically hidden from file listings.

### ✏️ Edit Agent — Reports To Dropdown
- **Visual reporting line** — Edit Agent modal now includes a dropdown to set the agent's manager.
- **Agent name + role** — Each option shows both name and role for clarity.

### 🔔 Notification Fix
- **No more `[undefined] undefined` toasts** — All notification emission points now have null guards.
- **Proper field mapping** — Proposal and blocker notifications correctly populate orgName and agentName.

### 📋 Proposals — Code Only
- **Filtered view** — Proposals tab only shows code change proposals.
- **Auto-approve** — Documents, plans, and hiring decisions are automatically approved (unless `requiresApproval: true`).

### 📊 Board Tab Improvements
- **Clickable health cards** — Expand to show full run summary, all file activity, and run history.
- **Focused view** — Removed proposals section and workspace browser (both have dedicated tabs).

### 🔒 Protection Visibility
- **View all protected files** — Expandable section in Settings showing every protected file, grouped by directory.
- **Git fix** — `snapshotGitFiles()` now runs from `org.rootDir` (not `workspaceDir`).

## 🏢 v12.0 — Autonomous AI Company Orchestration

### AI Organisations
- **Create up to 10 independent AI companies** with unique names, missions, and root directories.
- **Org Isolation** — Each organisation operates in its own workspace with no cross-org data pollution.
- **Persistence** — All org data, agent memories, and shared company state saved to `orgs/`.

### Professional Agent Personas
- **Custom Roles** — Define any role (CEO, CTO, Lead Dev, Marketing, etc.).
- **Rich Identity** — Every agent has a dedicated name, personality, responsibilities, and specific goals.
- **Autonomous Memory** — Agents maintain persistent memory across runs, learning from their own past actions.
- **Shared Memory** — A company-wide context board visible to all agents in the organisation.

### Heartbeat & Trigger Engine
- **Cron Scheduling** — Set precise execution times for any agent (e.g., "Daily at 9 AM", "Every 15 minutes").
- **Event-Driven Workflows** — Delegation automatically triggers heartbeats for target agents.
- **Manual Control** — Trigger any agent run instantly from the dashboard or chat.
- **Skip-if-Running** — Smart concurrency protection ensures heartbeats never stack or overlap.

### Enterprise Ticket System
- **Kanban Task Board** — Manage work via Open → In Progress → Blocked → Done status.
- **Agentic Delegation** — Agents can create, update, and assign tickets to each other or to you.
- **Rich Context** — Each ticket includes descriptions, priority levels, comments, and full history trails.
- **Write-Lock Protection** — Concurrent agent access is safe from data corruption.

### Direct Agent Chat
- **Instant Communication** — Click any agent to open a dedicated, persistent chat session.
- **Separate Workspace** — Direct-chat panes are independent of the 3-pane human command center.
- **Persistent Sessions** — The agent retains full context of your direct conversation between messages.

### 🧩 Previous (v11.1) Improvements
- **Multi-Chat Workspace** — Up to 3 independent resizable panes for human commands.
- **Sub-Agent Workers** — Spawn up to 5 parallel workers per pane for background tasks.
- **Skill Lock System** — Global concurrent resource protection (Exclusive/Read-Write/Per-Path).
- **Graceful Shutdown** — Cleanly stops all heartbeats and saves all sessions before exit.
