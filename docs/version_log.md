## [10.4.0] - 2026-03-16

### New Multi-Media Skills
Implemented two powerful new skills for handling PDF documents and AI image generation.

#### New: `src/skills/pdf.ts` — PDF Management
- **`manage_pdf`** skill with 8 high-level actions:
  - `extract_text` — Full text extraction via `pdfjs-dist`.
  - `metadata` — Inspect title, author, page count, and version.
  - `merge` — Combine multiple PDFs into a single file.
  - `split` — Split PDFs by page ranges.
  - `rotate` — Batch rotate pages (90/180/270 degrees).
  - `watermark` — Add diagonal text watermarks with translucency.
  - `create` — Generate new PDFs from plain text/markdown content.
  - `extract_pages` — Slice specific pages into a new document.
- Built using `pdf-lib` for modification and `pdfjs-dist` (v5) for extraction.

#### New: `src/skills/imagegen.ts` — AI Image Generation
- **`generate_image`** skill with dual-model intelligent fallback:
  - **Imagen 3** (`imagen-3.0-generate-002`) — High-fidelity, photorealistic generations with support for aspect ratios (1:1, 16:9, etc.) and multiple variants.
  - **Gemini 2.0 Flash** (`gemini-2.0-flash-preview-image-generation`) — Lightning-fast creative generations.
- Features `auto` mode that attempts Imagen 3 first and falls back to Gemini Flash on any failure.
- Auto-saves all generated images to the `outputs/` directory.

#### Changed: `src/skills/index.ts`
- Registered both `pdfSkill` and `imagegenSkill` into the global skill registry.

## [10.3.0] - 2026-03-16

### PersonalClaw Browser Relay Extension

New Chrome MV3 extension that bridges PersonalClaw to the user's real Chrome tabs — no `--remote-debugging-port` flag needed.

#### New: `extension/` — Chrome MV3 Extension
- **`manifest.json`** — MV3 manifest with tabs, activeTab, scripting permissions.
- **`background.js`** — Service worker maintaining WebSocket connection to `ws://127.0.0.1:3000/relay`. Handles tab management, navigation, screenshot capture via Chrome APIs. Auto-reconnects with heartbeat.
- **`content.js`** — Injected on all pages. Rich DOM interaction: click (text/selector matching), type (character-by-character), scrape (text + links + forms + metadata), scroll, evaluate JS, get interactive elements, highlight. Visual indicator badge.
- **`popup.html/popup.js`** — Connection status popup with configurable relay server URL.

#### New: `src/core/relay.ts` — Extension Relay Server
- **`ExtensionRelay`** class — WebSocket server attached to main HTTP server at `/relay` path. Manages extension connections, tab state, and command routing.
- Promise-based command execution with timeout handling.
- Convenience methods: `listTabs()`, `navigate()`, `click()`, `type()`, `scrape()`, `screenshot()`, `switchTab()`, `openTab()`, `closeTab()`, `evaluate()`, `scroll()`, `getElements()`, `highlight()`.
- Singleton `extensionRelay` instance auto-started by the server.

#### Changed: `src/skills/browser.ts`
- 12 new relay actions: `relay_tabs`, `relay_navigate`, `relay_click`, `relay_type`, `relay_scrape`, `relay_screenshot`, `relay_switch_tab`, `relay_open_tab`, `relay_close_tab`, `relay_evaluate`, `relay_scroll`, `relay_elements`.
- `tab_id` parameter for targeting specific Chrome tabs.
- Updated skill description with three-mode decision guide.

#### Changed: `src/core/brain.ts`
- **`/relay`** slash command — shows extension connection status and open tabs list.
- System prompt updated with Extension Relay mode documentation and decision guide.
- `/relay` added to help table and known commands.

#### Changed: `src/index.ts`
- Extension relay attaches to main HTTP server at `/relay` WebSocket path.
- Relay shutdown on graceful exit.
- `GET /api/relay` REST endpoint for relay status.
- Relay events in activity feed (connected, disconnected, tabs updated).
- Startup banner shows relay WebSocket port.

#### Changed: `src/core/events.ts`
- New event constants: `RELAY_CONNECTED`, `RELAY_DISCONNECTED`, `RELAY_TABS_UPDATE`.

#### How to Use
```
# 1. Load extension in Chrome:
#    chrome://extensions → Developer Mode → Load Unpacked → select extension/ folder

# 2. Extension auto-connects to PersonalClaw (ws://127.0.0.1:3000/relay)

# 3. Check status:
/relay

# 4. Use relay actions in chat:
# "List my open tabs"  → AI uses relay_tabs
# "Scrape the active tab" → AI uses relay_scrape
# "Click the Submit button" → AI uses relay_click
```

## [10.2.1] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **`setup.bat`** — One-click automated setup. Installs all dependencies (brain, browser, dashboard) and interactively configures `.env` with API keys.
- **`start.bat`** — One-click launcher for the entire system (Brain + Dashboard).
- **Resilient Boot** — Improved startup logs and error handling for missing API keys or disabled Telegram interface.

## [10.2.0] - 2026-03-16

### Chrome Native MCP & Dual-Mode Browser

PersonalClaw can now connect to the user's **real running Chrome session** — not a new instance, but the actual browser with all real logins, cookies, and active tabs.

#### New: `src/core/chrome-mcp.ts`
- **`ChromeNativeAdapter`** — connects to Chrome via two methods (auto-selects best):
  1. **Chrome 146+ native MCP server** — SSE transport to Chrome's built-in DevTools MCP. Exposes Chrome's own tools directly to the brain (prefixed `chrome_*`).
  2. **CDP fallback** — `chromium.connectOverCDP()` for any Chrome with remote debugging. Full Playwright API on the real session.
- **`ChromeNativeAdapter.probe(port)`** — static check for Chrome availability without connecting.

#### Changed: `src/core/browser.ts`
- **`getPage()`** now prioritizes native Chrome CDP page when connected, falls back to Playwright.
- **`connectNative(port?)`** — connect to real Chrome (delegates to `ChromeNativeAdapter`).
- **`disconnectNative()`** — revert to Playwright-managed mode.
- **`getStatus()`** — reports current mode and probes Chrome availability.

#### Changed: `src/skills/browser.ts`
- 4 new actions: `connect_native`, `disconnect_native`, `status`, `chrome_call`.
- Updated skill description with decision guide (native Chrome vs Playwright).
- `chrome_call` enables direct invocation of Chrome MCP tools by name.

#### Changed: `src/core/brain.ts`
- **Dynamic tool registration** — `createModel()` now includes Chrome MCP tools when connected.
- **`refreshModel()`** — reloads Gemini model with updated tool definitions after connect/disconnect.
- **`chrome_*` tool routing** — agentic loop routes Chrome MCP tool calls to `chromeNativeAdapter`.
- **`/chrome [port]`** slash command — probes Chrome, connects, shows status. `/chrome disconnect` to revert.
- **System prompt updated** — dual-mode browser explanation with decision rules for the AI.

#### How to Use
```
/chrome              # connect to Chrome on port 9222
/chrome 9229         # custom port
/chrome disconnect   # back to Playwright

# Or via browser skill:
browser(action="connect_native")
browser(action="status")
browser(action="disconnect_native")
```

#### Prerequisites
```
# Option 1: Launch Chrome with remote debugging
chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=%TEMP%\chrome-debug

# Option 2: Chrome 146+ auto-connection
chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging → enable "Discover network targets"
```

## [10.1.1] - 2026-03-16

### Bug Fixes
- **Browser Viewport**: Fixed the "fixed viewport" issue in the `BrowserManager`. By setting `viewport: null` and adding `--start-maximized`, the browser now scales naturally with the window size and provides a better interactive experience.

---

## [10.1.0] - 2026-03-15

### 🧹 Codebase Cleanup
- **Browser Consolidation**: Removed redundant `src/skills/relay.ts`, `src/skills/stagehand.ts`, and the `extension/` directory. Unified browser logic now resides in `src/skills/browser.ts`.
- **Workspace Declutter**:
  - Deleted obsolete root-level documentation exports (`PersonalClaw_Overview.md`, `PersonalClaw_Overview.pdf`, etc.) and temporary images.
  - Relocated utility scripts (`check_ssl.ps1`, `list_models.js`, `test_vision.js`) from the project root to the `scripts/` directory for better organization.
- **Persona Management**: Removed the unused `marketing` agent persona from `PaperClip/agents/`.
- **Infrastructure**: Purged the `dist/` directory and temporary `browser_data/`.

---
